Searching and Trees
===================

The text Algorithms in a Nutshell has a great review of the basic algorithms for search. As it says in the text, given a collection C  of elements, there are really 3 fundamental queries we might ask. (page 105)

* Existence: Does _C_ contain a target element _t_?
* Retreival: Return the eloement in _C_ that matches the target element _t_
* Associative lookup: Return information associated in collection _C_ with the target key element _k_
